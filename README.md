# Ion Format Support

Provides Ion File Formatting and Syntax Highlighting

## Features

- `Formatting`
- `Unpack or preserve Embedded JSON`
- `Syntax Highlighting`

## Known Issues

Syntax highlighting currently uses TypeScriptReact theme file which seems to work well with Ion files. Should be switching to a proper trimmed down version for Ion in future.

## Generating .vsix file

Run:
 -`npm-install`
 -`npm install -g vsce`
 -`vsce package`
